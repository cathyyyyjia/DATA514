Based on my experience using the DBMS cloud service, I think this is a great idea to offer DBMS as a public cloud service. At the very beginning, I felt frustrated when setting up the SQL server and online database because I had to do extra commands in MacBook Terminal and write SQL queries to check if the csv files are imported successfully. However, it takes advantages in local database storage and executing time-consuming queries. For this assignment, With Azure, I no longer need to store the database locally on my computer. Also, I could set up my SQL Server online which enables me to execute the complex queries in reasonable time. DBMS is quite convenient to use once I get familiar with it. Therefore, offering DBMS as a public cloud service is a great idea. I hope in the future the service price may be reduced as it gets more popular among public users.
